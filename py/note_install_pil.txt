#some problems when I install PIL(Python Image Library) on my macine.
#My machine: Max OS X 10.9.2
#Environment: python 2.7.5  
              GCC 4.2.1
              Compatible Apple LLVM 5.0
              Xcode 5.1.1

necessary libraries:
  JPEG support, libjpeg  install command: sudo port install jpeg
  PNG support, zlib install command: sudo port install zlib
  OpenType support, freetype2 install command: sudo brew install freetype

note1: I install freetype by using command "sudo port install freetype", but I didn't found it. Thus I change to command "sudo brew install freetype". It will be installed in "/usr/local/lib"


Try1(failed):
build source code directly. command "sudo python setup.py install"
error:
 "clang: error: unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]"
"clang: note: this will be a hard error (cannot be downgraded to a warning) in the future"

Try2(failed):
install PIL by using tool: easy_install .
command:"sudo easy_install pil"
error: It is same as Try1

Try3(failed):
install PIL by using tool: mac port.
command:"sudo port install py27-pil"
There is no error report. But I can't import PIL in a python program. 
I can't fix it.

Try4(failed):
I found out the way to fix the error in Try1 and Try2.
Maybe this error caused by Xcode 5.1, the compolier regard this as an error.
One fixd command: "sudo ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future easy_install PIL"
It works, but another error occurs. 
Error like this:
  fatal error: 'freetype/fterrors.h' file not found
  #include <freetype/fterrors.h>
         ^
  1 error generated.
  error: Setup script exited with error: command 'clang' failed with exit status 1

The way to fix this error:
link the library.
command "ln -s /usr/local/include/freetype2 /usr/local/include/freetype"

Try5(failed):
Fixed the error above. I install pil by using easy_install
command "sudo ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future easy_install PIL"
It works again. But I also can't import PIL in program. I'm very confusion.

Try6(succeed):
The last way I was succeed. I try to build pil source code again.
command:
  export CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments 
  export CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments 
  sudo python setup.py install

It works!!! My god! I can import PIL now.
