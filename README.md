FaceDetection
=============

Learning computer vision. Start with face detection.

Firstly, I implement a face detection framework. To training a cascade classifier using adaboost algorithm. I implement this framework according to the paper Robust Real-Time Face Detection from Viola and Jones. A very famous paper in the field of computer vision and face detection. I use python to implement it.
